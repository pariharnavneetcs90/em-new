                    This is why our goal has been supporting Indian women in the workplace and giving as much as possible to their local communities. Since our establishment, we’ve shared a dream with our makers for empowering all women to feel honoured with deep reverence for their being. Slowly, with love and intention, we’re empowering this dream.

                    With the help of your contributions, every Daughters of India purchase is not only preserving traditional craftsmanship, they are also donating directly to women empowerment initiatives in India through our charity partnerships. We have pledged an ongoing monthly donation of $10,000 to support Sewing the Seeds & Barakat Bundle reach their goals.
