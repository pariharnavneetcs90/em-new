                        Our slow fashion garments are hand-crafted and serve to support Indian women in the workplace as well as the preservation of ancient methods of textile production. We follow a zero-waste design and production process and produce minimal quantities to eliminate any possibility of excess waste. Every purchase contributes to women empowerment projects in India through our charity partners and supports local Indian communities to continue their sustainable hand-craftsmanship for future generations.
