                    Through her own journey as a Mother, Laura has intuitively centred her life around supporting women through cyclical living, pregnancy, birth, motherhood and beyond.

                    Ritualising feminine wisdom and holding sacred space for women through birth work led to Laura’s invention of a Ceremonial bowl handcrafted from clay, designed to support women in trusting their journey.

                    We loved enjoying a nourishing conversation over a cup of chai with this beautiful Finnish fairy in her rainforest studio cabin discussing her mother centred offerings, staying true to oneself and trusting in our path.

                    The calling to explore the path of birth work was something that came to me while I was pregnant with my second son. Inspired by the power and magic that is birth, I signed up to a doula training soon after he was born. He has recently turned five which means that I have been journeying with women and families in the capacity of a birth keeper for around four years now.

                    My birth and postpartum offerings are forever evolving and shifting. They are a gentle invitation to invest in yourself and your family. Through intentional birth preparation and deep and nourishing postpartum care, it is an opportunity to set yourself up for your future years as a mother/parent. I am here to love fully and to worship you and your choices.

                    I see the Ceremonial pottery as my passion project and something that was kindled by my love towards pottery and women’s work. To me, working with clay is moving meditation. It is a way to balance myself through the four elements of earth, water, air and fire that are all present when working with clay. The Ceremonial bowls are individually hand built from start to finish and custom made in collaboration with the vision of their owner. They are activated with prayer and there to hold space for women and their sacred ceremonies from childbirth to monthly bleed. I have only recently started to identify myself as an artist and carrying this energy feels so special and grounding.

                    My newest offering, a not-for-profit Sisters of the Earth Retreat was birthed last year. Sisters of the Earth is all about women experiencing the sacredness of sisterhood and the magic of being a woman. It is a safe space for women to connect with each other as well as an invitation to journey into themselves. I envision the retreats to take place twice a year and invite new sisters to join our growing heart centred community.

                    You have created the most beautiful offering of a Ceremonial bowl for women based on the concept of a Labyrinth. What is a Labyrinth Ceremonial bowl and what can they be used for?

                    The ancient and sacred symbol of labyrinth is found and experienced all over the world. Labyrinths have been painted on the walls, carved into floors and woven into fabrics for thousands of years. The age-old art of tracing the spiralling path of labyrinth has been associated with magic and they have always brought something different to the people experiencing them. A Labyrinth, normally experienced either by tracing or walking, reminds us of our forever evolving journey and constantly shifting perspective through life. With no need to figure out the windy path or how to reach the centre, Labyrinth invites us to drop into complete trust and surrender. We may not know the twists and turns of the labyrinth (life) but we can trust that by sticking to the path readily laid in front of us, we will always find our way through. When used as part of birth preparation, the message of labyrinth is heightened and can be something that will help to guide you on your birthing and motherhood journey. The pilgrimage of labyrinth is there to teach us that we can’t get lost when we stick to our path and stay true to ourselves.
