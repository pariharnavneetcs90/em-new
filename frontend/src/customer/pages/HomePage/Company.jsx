                    "Brown is beautiful" is a motto you often hear me say. My passion to spread awareness on the beauty of all skin colors of brown comes from my experience of feeling like I would only look beautiful if my skin was lighter. Colorism is a prominent topic not only in the South Asian community but many other communities as well. Not one color of brown skin is more beautiful than the other.Empowering women and each other is something I find very important. We all deserve our own success and happiness. Instead of comparing ourselves with each other, we must find peace individually and celebrate each other’s successes, big or small. We all come in different shapes, sizes, skin color, hair type, etc. Women are amazing and it is important to honor and showcase that!

                    Representation matters! Seeing yourself on media is so important and can affect your everyday life. It took me so long to finally embrace my culture and ethnicity. Embracing being Desi (South Asian specifically) and a South Indian woman is truly a huge part of my identity now! Embracing who you are and where you come from is not learnt but something that takes time to understand. Who you are is something no one can take from you, and that is a beautiful thing.. We all deserve our own success and happiness. Instead of comparing ourselves with each other, we must find peace individually and celebrate each other’s successes, big or small. We all come in different shapes, sizes, skin color, hair type, etc. Women are amazing and it is important to honor and showcase that!
