                        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                        In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                        Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

                        Our slow fashion garments are hand-crafted and serve to support Indian women in the workplace as well as the preservation of ancient methods of textile production. We follow a zero-waste design and production process and produce minimal quantities to eliminate any possibility of excess waste. Every purchase contributes to women empowerment projects in India through our charity partners and supports local Indian communities to continue their sustainable hand-craftsmanship for future generations.
